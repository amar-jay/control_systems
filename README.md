## README.
This repository serves as my structured learning path for mastering **control systems, state estimation, and filtering techniques**. The focus is on understanding fundamental principles, mathematical formulations, and practical implementations. 

### **üìç For Future Me, Read This!**

This roadmap is designed to keep me on track while learning these. Implementation is important, but **theoretical understanding is key**‚Äîso I will regularly document notes & insights, test and run simulations.
